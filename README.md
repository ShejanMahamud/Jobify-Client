# Problem Faced and Solution

One of the requirements was to ensure that job expiration statuses were automatically updated. To achieve this, I implemented a cron job that runs every 24 hours to check if any jobs have expired and update their status accordingly. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the approach:

1. **Cron Job Implementation**: Set up a cron job in the server that executes every 24 hours.
2. **Expiration Check**: The cron job checks the expiration date of each job posting.
3. **Status Update**: If a job is found to be expired, its status is automatically updated to "expired".

This approach ensures that job postings are accurately and efficiently managed without manual intervention, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the job listings.

Additionally, while developing this project, I created a captcha verification system and packaged it as an npm package called [react-awesome-captcha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-awesome-captcha).
